      <h2>Peace of mind</h2>
      <p>Take a sit please,<br>
        Try to be at ease,<br>
        And embrace the breeze,<br>
        Or else life will not cease, </p>

      <p>Throwing you at your knees,<br>
        Begging for what you seek,<br>
        Blindly ignoring what you need,<br>
        Failing to take heed,</br></p>

      <p>You'll lose track of the basics,<br>
        Dismantle the schematics,<br>
        Become one of those fanatics,<br>
        Living lives that are dramatic.</br></p>

      <h2>Dusk</h2>
      <p>
        Golden rays of sun<br>
         Treasure to be plundered<br>
         Stolen by the night

          <h2>Dance</h2>
          <p>
            A language that transcends near and far<br>
            With every graceful movement and leap<br>
            It touches our souls, so deep</br>
      </p>
            
            <p>In the sway of the body, a story is told<br>
            Of emotions, dreams and secrets untold<br>
            The rythm carries us, like waves on the shore<br>
            As we dance, we find ourselves thirsting for more</br> <p/>
            
           <p> Beauty lying in its expression,<br>
            A form of art that knows no repression<br>
            It speaks through bodies, in every twist and turn,<br>
            Pop and wave<br>
            A universal language, we all yearn</br> <p/>

            <p> From elegance to fierceness,<br>
            From rythm to flow,<br>
            The bliss i desire more,<br>
            Dance captivates, it sets our spirits free,<br>
            A celebration of movement, for all to see.</br><p/>

            <p> What better way can we express what we feel,<br>
            Than to bask in its beauty with a step<br>
            A step into a whole new world<br><p/>

                 <h2>Father's embrace</h2>
              <p>The peace I seek is found,<br>
              Found in nothing but,<br>
              Nothing but the arms,<br>
              The arms open wide,<br>
              The arms open wide to receive me</br></p>
                 
                 <p>I'm talking about the arms that carry me,<br>
                 That carry me to a place so ethereal,<br>
                 In this place I find solace,<br>
                 What a wonder to know that it is my father's arms,<br>
                 That fully embrace me</br></p>
                 
                 <p>Shielded, I'm cradled, comforted and secure,<br>
                 He loved me very much,<br>
                 That he became flesh,<br>
                 Only to suffer for my sake,<br>
                 And he died to pave the way,</br></p>

                 <p>That we may meet again,<br>
                 In a place called paradise,<br>
                Where I will take a rest,<br>
                 Knowing i'm safe,<br>
                   Within my father's reach.</br></p>

       <h2>2017</h2>
       <p>I want to go back to a time,<br>
       Where I wasn't scared to fall asleep,<br>
       When my wishes were like dreams,<br>
       That seemed not to end.<br></p>

       <p>When my nightmares weren't something worth considering,<br>
       As part of my current reality,<br>
       A time when I laughed with my heart,<br>
       A time being young seemed eternal.<br></p>

       <h2>Another love</h2>
<p>Lately the mind has been bothered <br>
By the idea of another<br>
Digging in quite further<br>
Yet afraid to accept the matter<br></p>

<p>Wondering whether it's love <br>
Or just a feeling <br>
That needs to shove off<br> 
Maybe it's just a lie<br></p>

<p>That two souls intertwine <br>
But aren't destined to be<br>
Like a moment in time<br>
They will cease to be<br></p>

       <h2>Sunshine</h2>
       <p>How lovely it is!<br>
       To have light shining so bright in your life,<br>
       One that shines so bright like the happy,<br>
       Yellow fellow up in the sky,<br>
       Smiling down on me so hard,<br>
       That the heat meets my skin,<br>
       Though sometimes I wish he'd dissappear,<br>
       Beacause he is too much,<br>
       But yet again, I need him like never before.<br></p>

       <p>How lovely it is!<br>
      To have him as my sunshine<br>
       Lighting up my dark world extravagantly,<br>
       Little did I know I'd be this blissful!<br>
       Always jolly like the little children,<br>
       Prolly because of my sunshine<br>
      My sunshine in the rain,<br>
       And you are that sunshine<br></p>

       <h2>You've changed</h2>
        <p>They told you to go slow,<br>
        But you ignored the signs,<br>
        Now look at you,<br>
        Lying in memories of your past,<br></p>
        
        <p>They told you don't trust the smile,<br>
        But you let your feelings blind you,<br>
        thinking everyone is the same,<br>
        While the knives went through your back<br></p>
        
        <p>You thought things could become clear,<br>
        Only if you grew soft,<br>
        And allowed it all to consume you,<br>
        Burying yourself in an illusion<br></p>
        
        <p>In the end,<br>
        Its all clear to you,<br>
        But you are not the same,<br>
        You have become someone else,<br>
        Someone you always escaped.<br></p>
