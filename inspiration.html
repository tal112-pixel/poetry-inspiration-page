      <h2>Peace of mind</h2>
      <p>Take a sit please,<br>
        Try to be at ease,<br>
        And embrace the breeze,<br>
        Or else life will not cease, </p>

      <p>Throwing you at your knees,<br>
        Begging for what you seek,<br>
        Blindly ignoring what you need,<br>
        Failing to take heed,</br></p>

      <p>You'll lose track of the basics,<br>
        Dismantle the schematics,<br>
        Become one of those fanatics,<br>
        Living lives that are dramatic.</br></p>

      <h2>Dusk</h2>
      <p>
        Golden rays of sun<br>
         Treasure to be plundered<br>
         Stolen by the night

          <h2>Dance</h2>
          <p>
            A language that transcends near and far<br>
            With every graceful movement and leap<br>
            It touches our souls, so deep</br>
      </p>
            
            <p>In the sway of the body, a story is told<br>
            Of emotions, dreams and secrets untold<br>
            The rythm carries us, like waves on the shore<br>
            As we dance, we find ourselves thirsting for more</br> <p/>
            
           <p> Beauty lying in its expression,<br>
            A form of art that knows no repression<br>
            It speaks through bodies, in every twist and turn,<br>
            Pop and wave<br>
            A universal language, we all yearn</br> <p/>

            <p> From elegance to fierceness,<br>
            From rythm to flow,<br>
            The bliss i desire more,<br>
            Dance captivates, it sets our spirits free,<br>
            A celebration of movement, for all to see.</br><p/>

            <p> What better way can we express what we feel,<br>
            Than to bask in its beauty with a step<br>
            A step into a whole new world<br><p/>

                 <h2>Father's embrace</h2>
              <p>The peace I seek is found,<br>
              Found in nothing but,<br>
              Nothing but the arms,<br>
              The arms open wide,<br>
              The arms open wide to receive me</br></p>
                 
                 <p>I'm talking about the arms that carry me,<br>
                 That carry me to a place so ethereal,<br>
                 In this place I find solace,<br>
                 What a wonder to know that it is my father's arms,<br>
                 That fully embrace me</br></p>
                 
                 <p>Shielded, I'm cradled, comforted and secure,<br>
                 He loved me very much,<br>
                 That he became flesh,<br>
                 Only to suffer for my sake,<br>
                 And he died to pave the way,</br></p>

                 <p>That we may meet again,<br>
                 In a place called paradise,<br>
                Where I will take a rest,<br>
                 Knowing i'm safe,<br>
                   Within my father's reach.</br></p>

       <h2>2017</h2>
       <p>I want to go back to a time,<br>
       Where I wasn't scared to fall asleep,<br>
       When my wishes were like dreams,<br>
       That seemed not to end.<br></p>

       <p>When my nightmares weren't something worth considering,<br>
       As part of my current reality,<br>
       A time when I laughed with my heart,<br>
       A time being young seemed eternal.<br></p>

       <h2>Another love</h2>
<p>Lately the mind has been bothered <br>
By the idea of another<br>
Digging in quite further<br>
Yet afraid to accept the matter<br></p>

<p>Wondering whether it's love <br>
Or just a feeling <br>
That needs to shove off<br> 
Maybe it's just a lie<br></p>

<p>That two souls intertwine <br>
But aren't destined to be<br>
Like a moment in time<br>
They will cease to be<br></p>

       <h2>Sunshine</h2>
       <p>How lovely it is!
       To have light shining so bright in your life,
       One that shines so bright like the happy,
       Yellow fellow up in the sky,
       Smiling down on me so hard,
       That the heat meets my skin,
       Though sometimes I wish he'd dissappear,
       Beacause he is too much,
       But yet again, I need him like never before.</p>

       <p>How lovely it is!
      To have him as my sunshine
       Lighting up my dark world extravagantly,
       Little did I know I'd be this blissful!
       Always jolly like the little children,
       Prolly because of my sunshine,
      My sunshine in the rain,
       And you are that sunshine</p>
